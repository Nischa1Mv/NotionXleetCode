# NotionXLeetCode

## Overview
I often use the **Feynman Method** (named after physicist Richard Feynman) to track my LeetCode progress. This learning technique involves documenting problems to reinforce understanding.

### Current Process
Each time I solve a problem, I need to record various details:
- Problem description
- Difficulty level
- Related topics
- Solution approach

This manual documentation process becomes time-consuming, so I created this extension to automate it. The extension leverages an open-source LeetCode API to fetch problem information automatically.

## Long-term Vision
Eventually, I plan to expand this project to help users create and maintain their own Notion databases for tracking coding progress. Users will be able to:
- Provide their Notion page IDs 
- Set appropriate permissions
- Track their coding journey efficiently
