# NotionXLeetCode

## Overview
I often use the **Feynman Method** (named after physicist Richard Feynman) to track my LeetCode progress. This learning technique involves thoroughly documenting problems to reinforce understanding and ensure knowledge retention.

### Current Process
Each time I solve a problem, I need to record various details:
- Problem description
- Difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- Related topics and algorithms
- My solution approach and implementation
- Key insights and learning points

This manual documentation process becomes time-consuming, which is why I created this extension to automate it. The extension extracts question details from LeetCode and seamlessly integrates them into a Notion database using the Notion API.

### Notion Template
You can find the Notion template I use for this project [here](https://sleet-quality-d08.notion.site/201dc128dd6580219324cc7ea77d4ccc?v=201dc128dd6580a19f13000c29133845&source=copy_link). Feel free to duplicate it for your own use.

### Features
- One-click problem documentation
- Automatic extraction of problem metadata
- Direct integration with Notion
